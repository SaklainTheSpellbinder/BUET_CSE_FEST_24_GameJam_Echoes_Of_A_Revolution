Welcome to “Echoes of a Revolution"! 

Our game “Echoes of a Revolution” is a heartfelt tribute to all the heroes of the revolution. Our students, crowned as valiant knights in our memories, embark on a journey laden with obstacles.
The ultimate goal? To face and defeat the final dictator surrounded by her guards (you can guess who it is). Even if you stumble or fall, true heroes never die. 
Every time a hero falls, their spirit rises—stronger, brighter. Their courage, dreams, and love for a better world don’t disappear; they continue, passed down through us. 
Their souls live with us, woven into our very being. They remind us that the revolution isn’t over. It’s their spirit that keeps it alive long after their bodies are gone. 
Heroes become immortal not in spite of their sacrifice, but because of it.

How to play: Here is a quick guideline on how to play this game:

Start: When you first open this application, you'll see a message commemorating the heroes of our revolution. Press the ‘space bar’ and the game starts.
Jump: When a corrupt soldier appears, our hero leaps to dodge. Press the ‘space bar’, ‘W’, or ‘up arrow’ keys to jump.
Duck: You'll also see helicopters raining bullets on our students. To dodge these, press ‘S’ or ‘down arrow’.
Win: At 4,000 points, the ultimate villain (hint: Apa ;) ) appears, and time slows. Jump and press ‘A’ to defeat her.
Let the revolution echo through you.
